# Good Cause Outreach Maps

Maps to help identify properties to prioritize for outreach about good Cause eviction protection made for [Ridgewood Tenants Union (RTU)](http://ridgewoodtenantsunion.org/). 

Looking for non-rent stabilized properties in RTU zip codes that are not owner-occupied. Start by taking all properties from City Planning's PLUTO database with 1-5 residential units. Then use scraped tax documents from Department of Finance to identify and remove properties claiming the STAR tax benefit (which requires the property to be owner-occupied). 

Maps are available for each zip code:
